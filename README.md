# campus-arena Project Overview

**Name:** CampusArea

**Overview:**
CampusArena is a lightweight web app that helps students access campus knowledge more easily.
We provide a simple Q&A experience where students can browse questions, share insights, and learn from peers who’ve been through the same classes and experiences.

**Tech Stack (current):**
- Frontend: Vite + React + TypeScript (SPA in `ca-frontend`)
- Backend: none yet (local mock data only)
- Target hosting: static build; backend/API to be added later (planned: Supabase/Postgres)

**MVP Scope:**
- Questions feed
- Answers from students
- Mobile-friendly web interface
